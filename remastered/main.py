# EVERYTHING IN SI!!!!

# ok, here's the deal
# we solving the differential equation based on the paper Sch√ºssler Rempel 2018
# Phi/2pi y d^2y/dz^2 = y^4 - 8 pi (p_e -p_i)
# y = sqrt(B_0(z))
# at the bottom they always assume that B = sqrt(8 pi (p_e - p_i))

# they in particular choose some weird iteration btw
# p_e is fixed external pressure far away from the sunspot
# phi is ughhhh idk? is it fixed? cant be TBD!!

# p_i comes from hydrodynamic equilibrium dp/dz = g rho
# rho has to be optained from state eq? TBD

# we also solve temperature from energy transport
# for that we need opacity and some thingies for convection which also use opacity and rho

# each timestep there is mass flowing in at the bottom, that changes the pressure
# it needs to be adjusted using eq 15 (solved in the paper via newton method)
# velocity of the inflow which is in that eq also caculated form elsewhere, here the eq 17
# after adjustment it has to be updated (i e integrated) throughout the whole tube
