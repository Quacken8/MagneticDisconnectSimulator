//TODO - test y solver
//TODO - test T solver

//TODO - ask about what Zbase might be
//TODO - get the most correct mass fractions of the Sun
//TODO - find out why the opacities arent too right for higher temps and densities
//TODO - get density out of the PT eos, it is put there as the fortran intended out input, it better come out lol

//TODO - the ideal gas stuff seems to be wrong; the german paper denizer cites uses slightly different mu and c_p
//TODO - implement the real gradient as actually minimum of radiative and CONVECTIVE not adiabatic (convective is prolly the âˆ‡' from schussler rempel)
