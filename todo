//TODO - test y solver
//TODO - test T solver
//TODO - make the padding factor of guessed ode int derived from the step size

//FIXME - chech that eos derivatives arent d/dlnT but rly d/dT and such
//FIXME - fix the opacity 
//FIXME - solve the problem of zero dimensional np arrays better than using the [()] operator
//FIXME - make sure the integrators return values in the same order no matter what side its being integrated from

//TODO - how am i supposed to do that? If my initial value is for bottom pressure (from inlow), I need also bottom T, but schussler is fixing top temperature? -- solution the way bárta did it 
//TODO - ask about boundary conditions of B, theyre given at the top and bottom of the integration domain as opposed to using bottom value and derivative of it; use scipy boundary value problem solver?

//TODO - rethink Data and how it stores new datapoints
//TODO - benchmark root finding algos
//TODO - have a look at scipy's use_solver, u might be able to pick the best solver for u (only saw it in sparse matrix but id)

//TODO - see if sympy might be better for integration or derivatives 
//TODO - implement the real gradient as actually minimum of radiative and CONVECTIVE not adiabatic (convective is prolly the ∇' from schussler rempel)
