//TODO - test y solver
//TODO - test T solver
//TODO - test differences matrices for non uniform steps
//TODO - make the padding factor of guessed ode int derived from the step size

//FIXME - find out why your solution is ~ twice as big -- OPACITY??
//FIXME - chech that eos derivatives arent d/dlnT but rly d/dT and such
//FIXME - fix the opacity 
//FIXME - solve the problem of zero dimensional np arrays better than using the [()] operator

//TODO - ask about the direction of integration; is he integrating from bottom up (as schussler rempel suggests?)
//TODO - how am i supposed to do that? If my initial value is for bottom pressure (from inlow), I need also bottom T, but schussler is fixing top temperature?
//TODO - apparently bárta uses modelS temperatures (see solvers.py integrate_pressure)

//TODO - see if sympy might be better for integration or derivatives 

//TODO - implement the real gradient as actually minimum of radiative and CONVECTIVE not adiabatic (convective is prolly the ∇' from schussler rempel)
