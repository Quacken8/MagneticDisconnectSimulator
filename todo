//TODO - test y solver
//TODO - test T solver

//TODO - implement eos and kappa from MESA
//NOTE - i have a hunch they will not cache the tables which could take up a lot of time -- check 
//TODO - the eos isnt returning mean molecular value, but number densities? it just doesnt do what the documentation says it returns

//TODO - ask about what Zbase might be
//TODO - get the most correct mass fractions of the Sun
//TODO - find out why the opacities arent too right for higher temps and densities

//TODO - the ideal gas stuff seems to be wrong; the german paper denizer cites uses slightly different mu and c_p
//TODO - implement the real gradient as actually minimum of radiative and CONVECTIVE not adiabatic (convective is prolly the âˆ‡' from schussler rempel)
