//TODO - test y solver
//TODO - test T solver

//FIXME - chech that eos derivatives arent d/dlnT but rly d/dT and such
//TODO - test the speed of mesa cache
//FIXME - fix the opacity 
//FIXME - solve the problem of zero dimensional np arrays better than using the [()] operator
//TODO - go through kappa and eos init and the functions that are called there. U just copied it from the original code and it might be wrong

//TODO - implement the real gradient as actually minimum of radiative and CONVECTIVE not adiabatic (convective is prolly the âˆ‡' from schussler rempel)
